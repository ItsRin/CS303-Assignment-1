# CS303-Assignment-1

This program was created in replit.com so I am not sure if it will run the way it's supposed to on Visual Studio.

How to use?

Make sure you have a data.txt file that has integers in it, 10 lines of 10 integers.

Once you have that, just download the files and compile the code, then run it and you will receive output that shows this.
